# Cool Code

This a repository where I save cool codes I've created to the different classes I took. I'll list them in here, and I'll upload them as soon as I go finding files in my computer...
Peace!


## Tarea.m

I wrote this code for a computer class. The code runs on Matlab and given a number, a number of bits assigned to the mantissa, and the number of bits asigned to the exponent, using floating point arithmetic. If the numer can be represented, then it'll tell you how, and finally it'll show the Gray representation.
